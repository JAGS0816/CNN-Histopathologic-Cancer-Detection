# CNN-Histopathologic-Cancer-Detection
Greetings! This repository encapsulates my journey through a captivating student project focused on cancer detection. Leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), I've endeavored to enhance the accuracy of identifying cancerous patterns within histopathology images.

Project Overview:

Objective: 
To implement a CNN-based solution for precise cancer detection in histopathological images.

Dataset:
Histopathologic Cancer Detection | Kaggle. (2023). Retrieved November 12, 2023, from Kaggle.com website: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection/data

Tools: 
Included tools for data preprocessing and visualization, optimizing the learning experience.

Documentation: 
Thorough documentation is available to provide insights into the project's implementation details.

Educational Insights:
This project is an integral part of my coursework, offering me hands-on experience in applying deep learning techniques to medical image analysis. By exploring the complexities of CNNs in the context of histopathology, I aim to deepen my understanding of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation in a medical setting.

How to Engage:
Feel free to explore the repository, review the code, and provide any feedback or suggestions. I'm excited to share the progress of this student project and welcome any collaborative insights from fellow learners and developers.
